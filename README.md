### 🔐 Phishing URL Detection

# Overview

This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning techniques based on URL and website-based features.
The model analyzes characteristics such as URL structure, domain information, security indicators, and traffic-related attributes to classify a website as Phishing (1) or Legitimate (-1).

Multiple classification models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier were trained and evaluated.
The final model was deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time prediction.
